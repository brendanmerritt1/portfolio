        "With the goal of creating an animated wallpaper for my desktop, I created a solar system shader with C++ and GLSL to begin my journey into procedural graphics. ",
        "I began with the resources from the book 'Ray Tracing In One Weekend' by Peter Shirley, and used this knowledge to create a ray tracer from scratch along with the procedurally generated textures needed to create this shader. With help from the abundance of resources from Inigo Quilez, the founder of ShaderToy, I was able to create a stunning animated shader that I imported into Wallpaper Engine to run on my desktop. ",
        "The math background needed for this project included vector algebra, basic algorithms, dot products, cross products, and the quadratic formula. Additionally, I used hash functions, noise algorithms, Fractal Brownian motion, and Spherical Fibonacci points to create the detailed procedurally generated textures."
